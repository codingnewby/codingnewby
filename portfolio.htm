			<h2 class="main">Work/Projects</h2>
			<p>I often do projects in my free time to challenge and improve myself with new things and refresh what I already know. Here are some projects I've decided to show.</p>

			<h2>Project Safe Society</h2>
			<p>Project Veilige Samenleving (translated to English: Project Safe Society) was a project at my school in late March - early April of 2022. We received the assignment of showing how we could make our society safer. Me and the two classmates I worked with chose raising awareness about drugs and alcohol being used more by minors.</p>
			<p>I made the homepage and the "Manieren om te stoppen" ("Ways to stop") pages, and I helped my classmates with their pages a little. This wasn't one of my greatest works but it was one of the earliest and shows how far I've come.</p>

			<h2>HTML Exercise</h2>
			<p>The HTML Exercise website was made purely to learn some new things about html & css and remember the basics since it'd been a while since I did HTML and CSS.<br> I did this around June 24 2022. </p><br><a href="https://over-mij.thatbellastuffz.repl.co" target="_blank">Click here to open the website!</a>

			<h2>Coding Core</h2>
			<p>Coding Core is a website I made for myself. I use a lot of websites when coding and I'm too lazy to keep typing in all my searches, so I just made this website to be able to press buttons instead of having to type everything out.<br> Coding Core includes resources such as images, pixels, gifs, HTML help (stackoverflow, HTML validator, etc), my favourite playlists I use as background music while coding, a functional note system, and more.</p>
